% Question
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question[10] Given an adjacency-list representation of a directed graph, explain how long does it take to compute the out-degree of every vertex.  Explain how long does it take to compute the in-degree?
\begin{solutionorbox}
    Let us assume an adjacency list $Adj$ represents a  directed graph G $\left< V, E \right>$.
    
    Then the out degree of any given vertex $v$ is $Adj[v]$. Furthermore, the sum of all $|Adj[0]|$ to $|Adj[|V|]|$ is equal to $|E|$, all edges.
    
    That is, \[ \sum_{n=0}^{|V|} |Adj[n]| = |E| \]
    We also have to visit every vertex $V$ to do so.
    
    Therefore, the time it takes to compute the out degree of every vertex is $\Theta(V+E)$.
    
    The in degree is equivalent to the out-degree of a graph:  $\Theta(V+E)$
    
    Alternatively, we can calculate it by having a hashmap of all vertices starting at 0 and visiting each vertex, incrementing the in degree of each vertex by 1 every time it is encountered in $Adj$. This also has a time of  $\Theta(V+E)$, though it uses an auxillary array.

% Question
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question[10] Give an adjacency-list representation for a complete binary tree with 15 vertices.  Give an equivalent adjacency-matrix representation.  Assume that vertices are numbered from 1 to 15 as in a binary heap.
\begin{solutionorbox}
	We are given a complete binary tree as shown below:
	
\begin{tikzpicture}
\Tree [.1 [.2 [.4 [.8 ] [.9 ] ] [.5 [.10 ] [.11 ] ] ] [.3 [.6 [.12 ] [.13 ] ] [.7 [.14 ] [.15 ] ] ] ]
\end{tikzpicture}

    Then an adjacency-list representation of a complete binary tree can be represented as such:
    

    $\fbox{1}\rightarrow\fbox{2}\rightarrow\fbox{3}$
    
    $\fbox{2}\rightarrow\fbox{4}\rightarrow\fbox{5}$
    
    $\fbox{3}\rightarrow\fbox{6}\rightarrow\fbox{7}$
    
    $\fbox{4}\rightarrow\fbox{8}\rightarrow\fbox{9}$
    
    $\fbox{5}\rightarrow\fbox{10}\rightarrow\fbox{11}$
    
    $\fbox{6}\rightarrow\fbox{12}\rightarrow\fbox{13}$
    
    $\fbox{7}\rightarrow\fbox{14}\rightarrow\fbox{15}$
    
    $\fbox{8}\rightarrow\fbox{$\emptyset$}$
    
    $\fbox{9}\rightarrow\fbox{$\emptyset$}$
    
    $\fbox{10}\rightarrow\fbox{$\emptyset$}$
    
    $\fbox{11}\rightarrow\fbox{$\emptyset$}$
    
    $\fbox{12}\rightarrow\fbox{$\emptyset$}$
    
    $\fbox{13}\rightarrow\fbox{$\emptyset$}$
    
    $\fbox{14}\rightarrow\fbox{$\emptyset$}$
    
    $\fbox{15}\rightarrow\fbox{$\emptyset$}$

The adjacency matrix representation is on the following page.

\question[10]
The \textbf{\textit{incidence matrix}} of a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ with no self-loops is a $\abs{V} \times \abs{E}$ matrix $B = (b_{ij})$ such that
$$b_{ij} = \begin{cases}
	-1 & \text{if edge }j\text{ leaves vertex }i\text{,}\\
	1  & \text{if edge }j\text{ enters vertex }i\text{,}\\
	0  & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}

Describe what the entries of the matrix product $BB^T$ represent, where $B^T$ is the transpose of $B$.

\question[10]
Trace through the $\proc{Topological-Sort}$ algorithm and show the ordering of vertices produced on the following DAG.  Assume your \proc{DFS} algorithm processes the nodes in alphabetical order and the edges for each node in the adjacency list are also listed in alphabetical order.\\

\begin{solutionorbox}
	Place answer here.
	One possible topological sort:
	
	Since we process nodes in alphabetical order, we will start at node m . There is no nodes we can travel to We will now mark m as visited (mark as explored).
	
	We move on to node n and mark as visited. We cannot go onto o or u just yet but we can visit q, so we mark it as encountered. We cannot visit any nodes from node q so we mark it as explored. 
	
	Move on to node o. Cannot move to any node yet so mark as explored. (mark x as visited)
	
	Move on to node p. (mark as visited). Move to node s, since you can. You can move onto node r as well. From r, we are looking in alphabetical order. u is on the adjecency list of u and we can visit it, so we will. From u, we can visit t. Back to node r, we will now visit node y. From y we will visit node v. From v we will go to w (alphabetical order.) from W we will go to z. From v we will finally go to x. 

	
	
	
	
	$\proc{Topological-Sort} = \left< m, n, q, o, p, s, r, u, t, y , v, w, z, x \right>$
